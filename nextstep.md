Here's a summary of the changes we've made:
Database Schema Updates:
Added an accessCode field to the Participant model for user identification
Changed totalPoints to totalRupiah in the Participant model
Changed pointsAwarded to rupiahAwarded in the Answer model
Changed points to rupiah in the Question model
Changed pointsRequired to rupiahRequired in the Reward model
Changed pointsSpent to rupiahSpent in the Redemption model
Fixed TypeScript/Mongoose type errors by changing Schema.Types.ObjectId references to String type
New Components and API Endpoints:
Created an AccessCodeGenerator component for generating and displaying access codes
Added the component to the Room detail page
Created a new API endpoint for generating unique access codes
Created a new API endpoint for validating access codes
Updated the participants API to handle access codes
Game Flow Updates:
Modified the join game flow to use a 3-step process:
Enter room code
Enter user access code
Enter name (for first-time participants)
Updated API responses to use Rupiah instead of points
Added toast notifications for better user feedback
Other Improvements:
Fixed TypeScript errors in the models
Added react-hot-toast for notifications
Made sure the changes are consistent across the application
Next Steps
Test the application thoroughly to ensure all components work correctly
Test the user flow from start to finish:
Admin generates access codes
User joins with room code and access code
User plays the game and earns Rupiah
User redeems rewards with Rupiah
Consider adding more features:
Admin panel for managing generated access codes
Ability to disable/enable access codes
Detailed analytics on participant performance and Rupiah earned
The application should now have a functioning game mechanics system based on Rupiah currency rewards instead of points, with proper access code generation and validation for participants.
