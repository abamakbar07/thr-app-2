General Recommendations
- Define Types: Create interfaces or types for your data structures instead of using any.
- Remove Unused Code: Regularly clean up your code to remove unused variables, imports, and functions.
- Follow ESLint Rules: Adjust your ESLint configuration if certain rules are too strict for your project, but be cautious as this can lead to less maintainable code.
