Next Steps for this project.
We need some adjustment the user flow from start to finish:
- Admin generates access codes.
- User joins with room code and access code.
- User plays the game and earns Rupiah (no need calculation for the final rupiah earn, use as same as question rewards).
- Each User can redeems their rupiah.
Consider adding more features:
- Admin panel for managing generated access codes (store to database)
- Ability to disable/enable access codes
- Detailed analytics on participant performance and Rupiah earned

After implementing all adjustment and new feature, please test the app by your side and if there any error, fix it directly and retest again until all error solved.
